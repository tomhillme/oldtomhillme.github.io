					<h3>About Me</h3>
					<p>
						My name is Thomas Hobohm. I live in Southlake, Texas. My family is fairly expansive. I have six siblings (Warren, Fredde, Phillip, Sutton, Morgan, and Shelby), and I love every one of them. I read my first programming book when I was eight, and I've been hooked ever since. Besides programming, my hobbies are Mathematics, Chess, and Reading. I'm a proud supporter of open-source software and try to put all the code I write on Github (At least the code I legally can).
					</p>

						I started my programming carrer with C++. After making some games, I realized that C++ was annoying and pointless (A.K.A. I discovered Python). After making some (better) games using Pygame, I started writing GUI programs with wxPython. At this point I started doing freelance programming work. I've since learned how to use GIT extensively and taught myself a huge array of Python libraries (most of which are not listed on the homepage). These libraries include Gspread, Swift, and Flask.

						When I first started programming websites, I thought it was boring (especially compared to writing real code). After learning how to use JavaScript and JQuery, making websites was easier (and more fun), however it still felt empty. Then, I discovered the Python libraries Flask and Django. This kickstarted me into learning more about the web than ever before.
					</p>

						I started freelancing using Freelancer.com. After a fallout with their (terrible) customer service, I switched to local jobs and using <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire">Reddit's Job Board.</a> I've received far more jobs since switching and still freelance today.
