Fear not, young padawan: I'm sure we can work these out!\r\n\r\n### DarkPython\r\nThere's a problem with programming education. Most schools use old technology which teach terrible practices. DarkPython is a fully featured IDE designed for kids programming in Python + Pygame. It is programmed in wxWidgets, Scintilla, and Pygame. Some of it's many features:\r\n\r\n* A tabbed editor.\r\n* Syntax Highlighting.\r\n* A full featured debugger.\r\n\r\nFeatures which are currently being worked on:\r\n* A pygame preview window.\r\n* A GUI debugger with line highlighting.\r\n\r\n### Hooded\r\nHooded is a project I work on in my spare time: A fast and fun 2D RPG-ish Platformer in Python + Pygame. You can find it [right here](http://superman3275.github.io/Hooded/)!\r\n\r\n### What I've Made\r\nI've made multiple projects in both C++ and Python. Right now I'm working on DarkPython. I also occasionally work on Hooded.\r\n\r\n### People I've Got to Give Thanks To\r\nMy Parents.\r\nMark Pedroza.\r\n\r\n### Contact Me!\r\nMy email is: superman3275@gmail.com!\r\nYou can talk to me on irc with the server irc.freenode.net on the channel ##dreamincode.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
