					<p class="bio">
						I am a passionate computer scientist with experience in web development, desktop software development, and algorithmic analysis. My experience includes handling Product Development for Software-Focused, shared-economy projects. I have experience managing teams and maintaining open-source software. In the programming realm, I specialize in Python, Ruby, and C. I believe learning to program unlocks potential, so I help run and teach local software development outreach programs. I also enjoy learning Chinese, playing Chess, and studying pure mathematics. I was a member of the Tech Wildcatters Emerge Program, where I combined my oral skills and development experience to work on lifesaving applications for first-responders.
